  <strong>fork()</strong>  creates a new process by duplicating the calling process.
The new process is referred to as the child process.  The calling
process is referred to as the parent process.

<p>Welcome to <strong>forks() for me!</strong>. A simple site wehre I publish my work, my rants, and my thougths.</p>
<p>What should you expect from this site:</p>
<ul>
<li>rants about the current state of technology</li>
<li>thoughts on the ongoing projects I work on</li>
<li>sarcasm</li>
<li>boring work related stuff (might be interesting for you though)</li>
<li>basically, anything I need to remember which, otherwise, I&rsquo;ll surely forget</li>
</ul>
<p>Why is it called like this, why <strong>forks for me</strong>? That&rsquo;s a good question, I&rsquo;m glad you asked.</p>
<p>Many, many years ago, when multithreading on Linux was a PITA, my boss tasked me with a simple job.
To write a multithreaded Perl program we needed for a newlly developed project. The gory details are unnecessary for this story. A couple of days later, this happened:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Him: Is that Perl program ready yet mate?</p>
<p>Me: Man, I&rsquo;ve tried with threads. Works fine on Windows but not so much on Linux.
I rewrote the whole damn thing using fork(). Are you OK with this?</p>
<p>Him: forks for me&hellip; ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
